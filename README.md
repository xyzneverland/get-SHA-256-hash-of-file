# get-SHA-256-hash-of-file
This code calculates the SHA-256 hash value of a file and prints it to the console. It uses the hashlib, os, and time modules to work with hashes, files, and time. The code prompts the user to enter a file name, checks if the file exists, and calculates its hash value. It then prints the value and file name, introduces a 10-second delay, and exits.
